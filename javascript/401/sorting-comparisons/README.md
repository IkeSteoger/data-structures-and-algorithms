Use `.sort` to compare not only values, but strings & objects.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

For this one we had some starter tests & some starter code. We just had to built out the comparetor functions - which at first felt difficult!! Luckily the year wasn't too bad - you can just sort them like normal numbers, which is fairly easy! Just need to do a `(b-a)` to get the proper order. As for the title, it was a bit trickier. Using Regex to remove the A/An/The was a bit of a doozy, but had to make sure to replace it with an empty string. After which, the comparison worked well.
