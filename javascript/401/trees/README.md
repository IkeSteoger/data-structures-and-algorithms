# Trees

Create a Binary Tree class, define a method for depth first traversal (`preOrder`, `inOrder`, `postOrder`) and create a Binary Search Tree sub-class for the Binary Tree class that uses the `add` and `contains` methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

For the binary tree class, I mostly worked with similar code to what Ryan demonstrated for us in lecture. I understand WHAT the functions are doing but still a bit confused on how I would ever know how to build those functions the way they did. That made building `add` and `contains` a bit of a doozy. I referred to Google & tried to work out some my own code based on StackOverFlow readings & GeeksForGeeks.
